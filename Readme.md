# Predicting Athlete Performance and Injury Risk Using Search Techniques and CSP

![Alt text](image.png) 

## 📖 Overview
This project evaluates athletic performance and predicts injury risk using **classical AI techniques** like search algorithms (A*, Greedy), Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), and Genetic Algorithms (GA). Instead of machine learning, it focuses on optimizing training schedules and flagging injury risks through structured search strategies.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- **Predict Performance**: Forecast metrics like goals scored (football), points (basketball), or race times (track).
- **Assess Injury Risk**: Identify athletes at high risk using training load, recovery data, and injury history.
- **Optimize Training**: Balance performance gains with injury prevention using search-based strategies.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Sources**: Public datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [SportsRadar](https://www.sportradar.com/), or [Football-Data](https://www.football-data.co.uk/).
- **Features**:
  - **Performance Metrics**: Goals, assists, distance run.
  - **Physiological Data**: Heart rate, weight, sleep patterns.
  - **Contextual Data**: Training intensity, injury history, weather conditions.
- **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize data, engineer features like "training load" and "overtraining events".

## 🛠️ Methodology
### Problem Definition
- **Performance Prediction**:  
  *Example:* Predict a football player’s goals in the next match.  
  **Objective**: Minimize error between predicted and actual performance.
- **Injury Risk Prediction**:  
  *Example:* Flag basketball players at risk of ACL tears.  
  **Objective**: Minimize false negatives (missed high-risk athletes).

### Algorithms & Techniques
| Technique               | Use Case                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Greedy Search**       | Prioritize immediate performance gains while respecting injury constraints. |
| **A* Search**           | Optimize training/recovery schedules using heuristic cost functions.    |
| **CSP**                 | Model constraints (e.g., training load vs. recovery time) for safe plans.|
| **Genetic Algorithms**  | Evolve optimal training schedules over generations.                     |
| **Uninformed Search**   | Explore training schedules without prior domain knowledge.              |

### Constraints
- Performance predictions must account for athlete health and resource limits.
- Injury predictions are bound by training load, recovery time, and medical history.
