# AI-project
This project aims to evaluate athletic performance and predict injury risk using classical AI techniques. Instead of relying on machine learning models, it employs search-based methods such as A, genetic algorithms, and rule-based systems to analyze movement patterns, optimize performance strategies, and identify potential injury risks



Project : Predicting Athlete Performance and Injury 
Risk Using Search Techniques and CSP 
Aim: Design an AI system that predicts athlete performance and assesses the risk of injury based 
on historical performance data, physiological metrics, and contextual factors. The system will 
use search techniques (Greedy, A*, Uninformed Search), Constraint Satisfaction Problems 
(CSP), and optimization algorithms (e.g., Genetic Algorithms) to predict performance outcomes 
and identify athletes at risk for injury. 
a. Data Collection & Research: 
 Dataset Overview: Use publicly available datasets from sources like Kaggle, 
SportsRadar, or websites like Football-Data, which contain historical performance data 
for athletes in sports like football, basketball, and running. Key features of the dataset 
include: 
o Athlete's past performance metrics (e.g., goals scored, distance run, strength training 
progress). 
o Physiological data such as heart rate, weight, sleep patterns, and physical tests. 
o Contextual data like training intensity, injury history, and weather or field conditions 
during performance. 
o For injury prediction: data such as the number of hours trained, previous injuries, 
recovery rates, and training routines might be crucial. 
 Data Preprocessing: 
o Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize numeric data, and 
encode categorical variables. 
o Feature engineering for injury risk prediction: Create additional features such as training 
load, frequency of previous injuries, or overtraining events. 
b. Problem Definition: 
The goal is to predict athlete performance and assess the risk of injury, using search techniques 
and CSP to determine optimal performance outcomes and injury risk scenarios. 
 Predicting Athlete Performance (Select only one sport): 
o Predict performance metrics like: 
 Football: Goals, assists, or total match impact. 
 Basketball: Points, rebounds, assists, efficiency rating. 
 Running/Track: Time to complete a race or distance, or personal best. 
o Optimization Goal: Minimize the difference between predicted and actual performance 
metrics for future matches or races. 
 Injury Risk Prediction: 
o Predict the likelihood of an athlete suffering an injury based on training data, physical 
metrics, and risk factors. 
o Optimization Goal: Minimize injury risk by analyzing current and historical training 
load, recovery rates, and injury history. 
c. Constraints & Objective Function: 
 Constraints: 
o Performance prediction must take into account available resources (training hours, rest 
periods) and the athlete’s physical condition. 
o Injury risk prediction is constrained by factors such as training load, recovery time, and 
previous injury history. 
o Resource allocation constraints: Training routines should be designed to maximize 
performance while minimizing injury risk. 
 Objective Function: 
o Performance Prediction Objective: Minimize the error between predicted performance 
(e.g., goals, race time) and actual performance, ensuring that performance forecasts are 
realistic and achievable. 
o Injury Risk Prediction Objective: Minimize the false negatives (athletes at risk who are 
not flagged by the system) in injury risk prediction, ensuring that athletes who are at 
higher risk of injury are identified correctly. 
o Optimization: The search for optimal training schedules that balance performance 
enhancement and injury prevention. 
d. Search Strategy Implementation: 
 Greedy Search: 
o Implement a Greedy algorithm to iteratively select the best possible action (e.g., training 
intensity, recovery periods) based on current conditions (athlete’s health, prior 
performance). 
o The algorithm would prioritize the highest immediate performance improvements, while 
respecting injury constraints. 
 A* Search: 
o Use A* Search to find the optimal combination of training and recovery schedules, 
considering constraints like past injuries, training load, and recovery time. 
o A* can help navigate through possible training strategies, evaluating each combination 
based on the overall “cost” (in terms of performance gains and injury risks). 
 Uninformed Search: 
o Implement Uninformed search algorithms to explore possible training schedules that can 
enhance performance and minimize injury risk without prior knowledge of the space. 
o The goal is to search across various combinations of training hours, recovery days, and 
performance metrics, to find optimal solutions. 
 Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP): 
o Model the injury risk and performance prediction problem as a CSP: 
 Constraints: 
 Injury Prevention: Training load must be balanced with recovery time 
to minimize injury risk. 
 Performance Maximization: Performance-enhancing training hours 
must be balanced with physical limitations and recovery needs. 
 Objective: Maximize performance while satisfying the injury risk constraints. 
 Genetic Algorithms (GA): 
o Use Genetic Algorithms to evolve an optimal training schedule over multiple generations. 
Each individual (solution) in the population represents a different combination of training 
load, rest periods, and recovery time. 
o Genetic operations will help evolve better solutions that balance performance and 
minimize injury risks. 
e. Comparative Evaluation: 
 Performance Comparison: 
o Compare the results of the Greedy, A*, Uninformed Search, and GA-based methods for 
predicting athlete performance and injury risk. 
o Evaluate the effectiveness of the optimization in terms of how well the predicted 
performance matches actual outcomes, and how accurately injury risks are flagged. 
 Evaluation Metrics: 
o Define the most suitable metrics for the required evaluation. 
f. Deliverables: 
 Working Prototype: 
o A functional AI system that uses search techniques and CSP to predict athlete 
performance for upcoming matches or races. 
o A system that identifies athletes at high risk of injury based on their current training 
schedule, previous injuries, and physical metrics. 
 Visualizations: 
o A dashboard displaying predicted athlete performance (e.g., goals, race time) for 
upcoming matches or events. 
o A risk heatmap that shows athletes’ likelihood of injury based on current training and 
physical metrics. 
o Performance comparison charts to show the effectiveness of different optimization 
techniques (Greedy, A*, GA). 
 Documentation: 
o Clear documentation outlining the steps taken to implement the search techniques and 
CSP, detailing the feature engineering and constraints applied. 
o A comparative analysis of the different search strategies used and their impact on 
prediction accuracy. 
o A discussion on the results, model performance, and potential improvements.
