# AI-project
This project aims to evaluate athletic performance and predict injury risk using classical AI techniques. Instead of relying on machine learning models, it employs search-based methods such as A, genetic algorithms, and rule-based systems to analyze movement patterns, optimize performance strategies, and identify potential injury risks
